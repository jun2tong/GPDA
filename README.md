# SYDE 671 - Final Project
Replicating results for the project. Forked from [seqam-lab](https://github.com/seqam-lab/GPDA).

# Requirements
This code is modified for newer version of PyTorch. 
Please refer to [PyTorch's web](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for installation.
Datasets are also loaded slightly differently.

```
torch==1.2.0
numpy==1.17.3
```

Will need to install [Vadam](https://github.com/emtiyaz/vadam/tree/master/pytorch).

# To run the code
The main function is `main4.py` located in src folder.
